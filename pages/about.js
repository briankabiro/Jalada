		<p>
			Have you ever submitted your post to a newspaper and 
			been rejected because there wasn't any space. You don't need
			a blog or anything. we give you a global audience and
			a collective place for you to give us an opinion
			I know facebook have become popular because they are easily shareable but the 
			we have turned to it because it is the best option
			Waraka wants to be the chatroom of a nation and where opinions and points of view
			are expressed. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The newspaper might be the only trusted medium of information in our country.
			Online news sites (you know them) have a reputation for headlines that will sell advertisements 
			and worst of all carry gossip. Think about how many times you have read items from certain outlets only for you 
			to feel  that you have been deceived.
			Not everyone of us can afford a newspaper or get the chance to read one everyday
			Your opinion will withstand tear and we will be visible and always accessible.
			Every Kenyan has a voice and a right to be heard.
			Waraka is making that easier.
			Although there is a huge chance that we might fail, we are prepared to take that risk.
			Speak Kenya, Speak
